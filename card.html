			<p>Penguins jump into the water to release air bubbles from their feathers allowing them to swim faster by reducing drag</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Scientific Family</span>: Spheniscidae</li>

				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: 20 Years</li>

				Although penguins have wings they are flightless birds who instead use their wings as flippers to help them swim in the water.
				Most penguins live in the southern hemisphere and no penguins live at the  North Pole.
				Large penguin populations can be found in New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa.</p>
